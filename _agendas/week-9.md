### Wednesday, Lab

- Vitoria presents [Weekly Interest](/projects/weekly_interest)
- Lecture: [JavaScript Introduction](/lectures/lab/javascript-introduction)
- Group JavaScript work sessions

Create a new HTML file and create a link to a main.js JavaScript file. Use that JavaScript file to complete each of these tasks in class:

1. Create a variable named `springBreak` with a string that was something fun you did over spring break.
1. Create a series of 6 math problems that all equal 66. For example, `6 * 11`.
1. Create a series of arrays that represent each of the work session groups. Each student should be one item in the array. Assign these arrays to variables.
1. Create a variable named `allStudentsHere` and give it a boolean value representing whether or not all the students are present today.
1. Create a variable named `studentsMissing` and give it a boolean value representing whether or not any students were absent today.
1. Bonus: Create a an array of each of the work session groups (an array of arrays) and loop through this array using a for loop. Use `console.log()` to log the index of the working group. Inside that for loop, create an additional for loop that logs each of the students in that working group.

### Homework
