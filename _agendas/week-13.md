  - What is the central theme in all the directions?
  - What is most similar between the designs and what is most different?
  - Which design is the most cohesive at the moment? What is it communicating?
  - Which design is the least successful? Why?
  - Is the interaction in each direction supporting the concept or is it distracting from it?
  - Which formal graphic design qualities (structure, grids, consistency, typography, color, scale...) are working? Which aren't? What would help refine the overall design?
  - Does the title of the project feel approrpiate?
  - How can the central theme be elaborated upon? What could push the project even further?
