### Instructions

1. In this project, you will create a typeface using HTML and CSS. It will have all letters, numbers,
and two special characters. Think about what it means to create a typeface for the screen rather
than for the printed page. How do the constraints differ from one to the other? Your concept
should inform the design of the typeface, and should reference the digital way the typeface is
created. Additionally, you will create a website to serve as a type specimen. The websiteâ€™s
design should expand the concept of your typeface.
