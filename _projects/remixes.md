### Instructions

1. I’d like you to imagine a website as a destination. The destination should be fictitious, but should have a reason for existing. Think about how one feels when they land on the page, what kind of information is necessary to communicate the goal of the vacation, and how the experience of being in the destination changes over time. How does time pass at your dream vacation? The website should feel alive and self-aware. The website can take the form of an environment, but doesn’t have to. You are also allowed to bring in any content (existing or imaginary) to the assignment, as long as it supports your idea.
2. In addition to the website, you are required to design either a  printed postcard to accompany and announce the project. The postcards should be printed on two sides, and include a URL to the project. Or, an animation to be posted on social media with the same purpose. Be prepared to explain why you chose one or the other.

### Goals

1. To consider a website as a living piece of art.
2. To think about how a website changes with time.

### Deadlines

Initial concept presentation April 21, 2017. Final critiques will be on May 10th and May 12th, 2017.
