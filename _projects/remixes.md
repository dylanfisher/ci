### Instructions

1. Find a poem to typeset. The poem should be written by an outside source, and be published online, either by the author or a third party at some point in time. Be prepared to explain why you chose the poem.
2. Typeset the poem on a webpage using basic HTML elements. The website should include the name of the poem, the author, the variation number, and a link to the next poem somewhere on the page. This archival notation should feel separate from the poem, and should be consistent on all of the pages.
3. Using only basic HTML elements, make 20 variations of the same poem. Each should be different from the next. Think about how breaking up each line affects the legibility. Think about scale, and consistency. How do you think the author would have intended the poem to be read? How would you design it? What would be the most inappropriate setting of the type be? Consider applying a system or theme to your changes i.e: with each change, the typesetting gets increasingly illegible.
4. Name your project
